## Research aim
This study aimed to assess the influence of human mobility on the abundance and extensiveness of *Aedes albopictus*, taking account of the lagged and nonlinear effects of total rainfall and mean temperature based on distributed-lagged non-linear models (DLNM).


## Data and Code sources

**Data:** a folder containing the processed data, including mosquito activity, weather data, and human mobility data.

**Model:** a folder containing all fitted models and sensitivity analysis models. In addition, summarizes the fitted model results and sensitivity analysis results.
